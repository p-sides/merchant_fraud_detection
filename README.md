# Fraud Detection Study
In the given data set a merchant was compromised by a fraudster and turned into a common point of compromise. 

This allowed the fraudster to:
1) Harvest customer account information
2) Commit fraudulent transactions at a later date with the compromised information

The date of compromise can be identified by a sudden increase in transactions of compromised accounts with the merchant, while the exploitation period occurs a few days after the compromise.

This script generates visuals to flag suspect daily transaction rates and identify the compromised merchant, compromise period, and exploit period.
