# Fraud Detection Study
In the given data set a merchant was compromised by a fraudster and turned into a common point of compromise. This allowed the fraudster to harvest customer account information, then commit fraudulent transactions at a later date with the compromised information.  The date of compromise can be identified by a sudden increase in transactions of compromised accounts with the merchant, while the exploitation period occurs a few days after the compromise.

This script generates visuals to identify the compromised merchant, compromise period, and exploit period.
